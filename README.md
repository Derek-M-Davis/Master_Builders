#### Original Goal:
> Make a computer build platform that allows you to show off your build. Have a User innerface to allow sign and saving of favorite builds.
#### Technologies Used
-React FrontEnd

-PHP BackEnd

-JavaScript

-Heroku Hosting application and CLI  

#### Approach Taken
>Working on the backend and frontend with a set of variables for the build allowed us to get off to a great start and stay away from merge conflicts for the most part after the work flow was established. Once we were able to render the beggining parts of the project to the page we began to build routes and check for continuity throughout the application. With some functionality built out we did a framwork of the page to see how the builds and the form were rendering on the page. Struggle to deploy without outside help was 

#### Challenges
>Starting on the weekend was a challenge as we are still humans and it's the holiday season. Work was pushed quickly on friday and began the struggle of hosting on Heroku to no avail. Various branch issues with a less than effcient .gitignore file plagued us for a day and a half but several pulls, deletes and reinstalls and we were back on. 

>Spelling errors and camelcased variables in PHP(13 variables in total) veered us off course for an afternoon but back on track we were ready to deploy to the cloud. naming conventions as well for the deployment files were some of the most frustrating things but thankfully our leader led us to the promise land.

#### Goals/Future Plans
> A user system in a language we had just learned in three days was quickly put on the backburner and we would much like some time to be able impliment that but with a final project looming I think we are very happy with how it turned out.
